# Natural Language Processing with deep learning
### Basics of NLP
The code used deep earning libraries. Here is some basics for understanding of those library
- [NLP in Pytorch](NLP_pytorch.ipynb)
- [RNN usages](char_rnn_classification_pytorch.ipynb)


# Implementations 
Here are some of the algorithm used in natural language processing based on deep learning algorithms.

- Word2Vec [Skip Gram](Skipgram%20with%20negative%20sampling.ipynb) [GloVe](GloVe%20-%20Global%20vectors%20for%20word%20representation.ipynb)
- Sequence to Sequence [Keras](seq2seq_translation_keras.ipynb)
